3. In your site search list, Please click `...` button of the rd server and set it as the default search engine.
4. ðŸŽ‰ Please open a new tab and enjoy rd.

Don't worry about not using Google as the default search console. rd will try Google as a fallback when
there is no matching alias you input.
